Game of Life
============

Just a project to teach myself SFML, some more in-depth C++, and play around with cellular 
automata.  The result is a bit of an architectural trainwreck, I don't suggest that *any* of 
this code is particularly good practice.

Credit where it is due:  the cellular automata update algorithm (GameBoard::update and friends)
is lifted, with some modifications, from Micropolis:
